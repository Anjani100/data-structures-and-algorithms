Here, in this project, we try to write codes for all types of data structures as well as algorithms in Python. Below is the list of data structures we have written code for till now:
#### Matrix
* Matrix Multiplication
Problem Description:
Given 2 user input matrix, figure out the matrix multiplication of the matrices (if possible) and return the resultant matrix.

Input:

A -> a (m * n) matrix
B -> a (p * q) matrix
Output:

C -> a (m * q) matrix if n = p, otherwise, Not Divisible!

#### Linked List
* Create a linked list.
* Display a linked list.
* Insert at the beginning of the linked list.
* Insert at the end of the linked list.
* Insert element after a particular value in the linked list.
* Insert element before a particular value in the linked list.
* Insert element at the k-th position in the linked list.
* Delete from the beginning of the linked list.
* Delete from the end of the linked list.
* Delete user inputted elements from the linked list.
* Delete after a particular value from the linked list.
* Delete before a particular value from the linked list.
* Delete at the k-th position from the linked list.
* Delete the entire list.
* Sort the entire list.
* Reverse a list.
* Count the number of nodes in a list.
* Search for a number in the list.
* Find the root n-th node in the list (in one scan).
